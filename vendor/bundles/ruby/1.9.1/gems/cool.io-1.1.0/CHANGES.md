0.1.4
-----

* Calibrate Rev::TimerWatchers against ev_time() and ev_now() when the watcher
  is attached to the loop to ensure that the timeout interval is correct.
* Add check to ensure that a Rev::Loop cannot be run from within a callback
* Store Rev::Loop.default in a Thread-specific instance variable

  an empty buffer.
* Added has_active_watchers? to Rev::Loop to check for active watchers

0.1.3
-----

* Fixed bug in Rev::Buffer read_from and write_to: now rb_sys_fail on failed
  reads/writes.
* Change Rev::Buffer memory pools to purge on a periodic interval, rather than
  whenever the GC marks the object.

  from rev_watcher.h to rev_watcher.c.

0.1.2
-----

* Commit initial specs

* Implement Rev::TCPSocket#peeraddr to improve compatibility with Ruby sockets
* Added Rev::Listener.close for clean shutdown of a listener
* Rev::Loop.default used to call ev_loop_default() (in C).  However, this
  registers signal handlers which conflict with Ruby's own.  Now the behavior

* Creating a new Rev::TCPListener will disable reverse lookups in BasicSocket
* Made backlog for Rev::TCPListener user-definable

  watcher object as an argument.  Documented use of defining an event
  callback as a block
* Subsecond precision for Rev::TimerWatchers
